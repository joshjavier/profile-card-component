## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to make my CSS a little more organized, following the principles laid out in [CSS Guidelines](https://cssguidelin.es/). I wrote descriptive comments beside code that I think might not be too obvious to other developers (or even to me a few months later!). I also learned to stop worrying and embrace BEM-like naming for my classes, after gaining a better understanding of the concept of [separation of concerns](https://cssguidelin.es/#misconceptions) (i.e., using classes in HTML markup is okay and does *not* automatically mean you're breaking separation of concerns).

### Continued development

I need more practice in CSS backgrounds&mdash;and the creative aspect of CSS in general&mdash;as working on the backgrounds is the most difficult aspect of this project for me.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Guidelines](https://cssguidelin.es/) - This comprehensive resource is a must-read for those who want to write better CSS (along with [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/)).
- [Designing Beautiful Shadows in CSS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/designing-shadows/) - Useful resource that talks about a better way of thinking about shadows and implementing them in CSS.
- [Width & Height vs. Positioning properies (top, right, bottom, left)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGKO0PGzFXQ) - A 6-minute video by Kevin Powell that clearly explains the relationship/connection between width/height and top/right/bottom/left CSS properties. Understanding this helped me in my implementation for the card header images.
- [object-fit](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/) and [object-position](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-position/) - Two CSS properties that change the behavior of images; took me a bit of experimentation to figure out.
